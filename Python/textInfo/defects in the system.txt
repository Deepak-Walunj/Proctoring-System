1. Takes around 5-6 seconds to load the mediapipe  model(✅done)
2. Not able to classify the image as error if something obstruct the face by mistakenly(✅done)
3. Not able to detect phone(✅done)
4. light on the face should be eventone
5. in the preprocessing part, model resizes the image dynamically. So when the face is near the camera it resizes the image to near
about 350 350 pixels and if the face is far then it resizes to 240 240 size(✅done using the minDistance function)
6. Combine the two functions in facePreprocessing, detectFaces and detect_faces, one is setting the flags and one is counting the
faces
7. Handling the redundant function in facePreprocessing, detect_landmarks, its use is to only have the eyes landmarks for the 
align_face function
