Objects detection model:-
Thanks to libraries such as YOLO by Ultralytics, it is fairly easy today to make robust object detection models with as little as a 
few lines of code. Unfortunately, those solutions are not yet fast enough to work in a web browser on a real-time video stream at 30 
frames per second (which is usually considered the real-time limit for video applications) on any device. More often than not, it will 
run at less than 10 fps on an average mobile device.

The most famous real-time object detection solution on web browser is Google’s MediaPipe. This is a really convenient and versatile 
solution, as it can work on many devices and platforms easily. But what if you want to make your own solution?

Comparison: MediaPipe vs YOLO
Feature/Aspect								MediaPipe									YOLO
Real-Time Performance		Excellent: Achieves 30+ FPS even on mobile.		Limited on web browsers/mobile; <10 FPS on average.
Ease of Deployment		Highly optimized for cross-platform deployment.		Needs GPU for real-time performance on lower devices.
Accuracy			High for specific tasks (e.g., hands, face).		Higher for general object detection tasks.
Resource Usage			Low: Optimized for mobile and edge devices.		Medium to High, especially with larger models.
Flexibility			Focused on specific tasks (pose, face, hands).		General object detection (supports various classes).

When to Use MediaPipe
Real-time performance on low-resource devices: Works exceptionally well in web browsers, embedded systems, or mobile devices.
Specialized use cases: Face detection, hand tracking, pose estimation, and holistic body tracking.
Cross-platform deployment: Minimal setup across various environments (mobile, desktop, browser).

When to Use YOLO
General-purpose object detection: Suitable for detecting a wide variety of objects with custom training.
Higher accuracy requirements: YOLO excels in object detection benchmarks when computational resources are available.
GPU support: Great for environments with dedicated GPUs for inference.
Building Your Own Real-Time Solution
If you want to create a custom real-time object detection solution for the web or mobile with 30+ FPS, you might combine the best of both worlds:

Start with MediaPipe:
Use it for optimized preprocessing, pose estimation, or tracking tasks.
Lightweight and runs on all platforms.
Integrate with a lightweight model like YOLO-Nano:

For general object detection tasks, use YOLO-Nano or NanoDet.
Convert the model to TensorFlow.js or TFLite for browser/mobile compatibility.
Optimize further:

Use quantization (e.g., INT8) to reduce model size and improve speed.
Leverage WebAssembly (Wasm) or WebGPU for faster computation in browsers.

Conclusion
MediaPipe is an excellent choice for real-time, web-compatible, and low-resource applications. However, for a fully custom object detection solution with multiple classes, you might consider integrating it with a lightweight YOLO variant or another efficient model.

Eye Ball Tracking using mediapipes Iris
new machine learning model for accurate iris estimation. Building on our work on MediaPipe Face Mesh, this model is able to track 
landmarks involving the iris, pupil and the eye contours using a single RGB camera, in real-time, without the need for specialized 
hardware. Through use of iris landmarks, the model is also able to determine the metric distance between the subject and the camera 
with relative error less than 10% without the use of depth sensor. Note that iris tracking does not infer the location at which 
people are looking, nor does it provide any form of identity recognition. Thanks to the fact that this system is implemented in 
MediaPipe — an open source cross-platform framework for researchers and developers to build world-class ML solutions and applications
 — it can run on most modern mobile phones, desktops, laptops and even on the web.

An ML Pipeline for Iris Tracking
The first step in the pipeline leverages our previous work on 3D Face Meshes, which uses high-fidelity facial landmarks to generate a 
mesh of the approximate face geometry. From this mesh, we isolate the eye region in the original image for use in the iris tracking 
model. The problem is then divided into two parts: eye contour estimation and iris location. We designed a multi-task model 
consisting of a unified encoder with a separate component for each task, which allowed us to use task-specific training data.

Depth-from-Iris: Depth Estimation from a Single Image
Our iris-tracking model is able to determine the metric distance of a subject to the camera with less than 10% error, without 
requiring any specialized hardware. This is done by relying on the fact that the horizontal iris diameter of the human eye remains 
roughly constant at 11.7±0.5 mm across a wide population [1, 2, 3, 4], along with some simple geometric arguments.

n order to quantify the accuracy of the method, we compared it to the depth sensor on an iPhone 11 by collecting front-facing, 
synchronized video and depth images on over 200 participants. We experimentally verified the error of the iPhone 11 depth sensor to 
be < 2% for distances up to 2 meters, using a laser ranging device. Our evaluation shows that our approach for depth estimation using 
iris size has a mean relative error of 4.3% and standard deviation of 2.4%. We tested our approach on participants with and without 
eyeglasses (not accounting for contact lenses on participants) and found that eyeglasses increase the mean relative error slightly to 
4.8% (standard deviation 3.1%). We did not test this approach on participants with any eye diseases (like arcus senilis or pannus). 
Considering MediaPipe Iris requires no specialized hardware, these results suggest it may be possible to obtain metric depth from a 
single image on devices with a wide range of cost-points.

This is a challenging task to solve on mobile devices, due to the limited computing resources, variable light conditions and the 
presence of occlusions, such as hair or people squinting. Iris tracking can also be utilized to determine the metric distance of the 
camera to the user.

Release of MediaPipe Iris
We are releasing the iris and depth estimation models as a cross-platform MediaPipe pipeline that can run on desktop, mobile and the 
web. As described in our recent Google Developer Blog post on MediaPipe on the web, we leverage WebAssembly and XNNPACK to run our 
Iris ML pipeline locally in the browser, without any data being sent to the cloud.

Recommendation Based on EC2 Usage
For t2.micro: Use SFace only. ArcFace is too slow, and FaceNet512 crashes.
For t3.micro: ArcFace is a good option, but SFace is still the best for handling more users.
For GPU-based EC2 (g4dn.xlarge, etc.): FaceNet512 or ArcFace will work efficiently.
For Large-Scale Cloud Deployment: SFace is the best due to its speed and efficiency.
