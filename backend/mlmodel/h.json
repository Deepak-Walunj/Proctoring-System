While they show a good grasp of certain domains (e.g., retail store management strategies), their responses are frequently hampered by a lack of detail, poor organization, and insufficient depth of knowledge in other areas (e.g., performance management, customer service conflict resolution).  In one instance, the response was completely inadequate.  Although speech fluency and clarity are generally acceptable, improved coherence and a more structured approach to answering questions are necessary for better performance.  The candidate needs to demonstrate a stronger ability to articulate clear, comprehensive, and relevant answers, providing specific details and examples to support their claims.\n",
